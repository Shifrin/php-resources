While developing, there's often a confusion between a `core PHP developer` and a
`vanilla/plain PHP developer`. This article will explain a difference between
them to avoid further confusion.

## Core PHP Developer

A `core PHP developer` is someone who is actively developing the PHP language
itself and not developing something with the PHP language directly. So a core PHP
developer writes C code and extends the [PHP core](https://github.com/php/php-src)
or develops [PHP extensions](http://php.net/manual/en/internals2.structure.php),
which are written in C programming language.

## Vanilla or Plain PHP Developer

A `vanilla PHP developer` or `plain PHP developer` (vanilla is preferred) is
developing a website using the PHP language without any 3rd party libraries or
frameworks. So the vanilla developer actually uses the language used in the name.

## Conclusion

As long as you are writing PHP code and not rely on any 3rd party libraries or
frameworks, you are a `vanilla PHP developer` if you are
however writing on the PHP core itself, you can be considered a `core PHP developer`.
